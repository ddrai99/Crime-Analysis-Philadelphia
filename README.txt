To run the code:

1. Ensure that all the files are in same folder
2. All the libraries should be installed

Challenges in the code:

1. The training of model was computationally expensive. 
2. Only KNN Model could be trained and that too took 30 mins to train.
3. Had to interupt Random Forest Model since it was taking too long to train
4. The dataset is available only upto 23rd October 2023.
